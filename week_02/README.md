# Week 2 Notes

1)
Has the changes in the data collection process for crime stats lead to an under reporting?
- People say that crime is down but the truth will lie in the self victimization survey where people are asked if they have had a crime done to them.

2)
Theory of economics says that supply should follow demand. Are there places in the country where this pattern is weaker, particularly in the housing markets. Said simply are their areas where the supply of houses has kept up with demand?
_ finding data sets for the country might be hard but comparing key cities might be a good place to start.
- there are already studies that have looked into this.

3)
Is the Global population adding up? (I would only look for a few countries)
- I didnt get a chance to ask about this one but the idea is that because salt is an elastic good it resists changes in its demand. Idealy a certain number of people will always continue to demand a similar amount. It stands to reason that if the amount of salt demanded doesnt match projections based on populations. It likely means that the census was wrong.

4)
Market timing is the strategy of using key indicators to enter or leave the market as to get the best returns and minimize losses. The book "All about market timing" gives a list of 10 key indicators. Are these indicators reliable?.
- Best theory says that markets are efficient meaning that they are in effect a random walk. If this is true then there should be no way to "Time the Markets"
- Warren Buffet has stated in interviews that only fools try to time the market. His expertise is worth considering.
-notable hedge fund "medallion fund" had returns of 60% for 30 years this should not be possible for an effecient market. so its worth looking into.

## Task

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

flights <- flights %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(dep_delay),
    !is.na(carrier)
  )

ggplot(flights, aes(carrier, dep_delay)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()+ labs(title ="Flight Delays by Carriers", x = "Carrier", y = "Flight Delays in minutes")
```

The graph above selects for the carriers that had the most delays in the data set. The graph above shows that the carriers over all tend get to leave at a respectable time. This is important because the many parts of logistics has to do with getting people to their next flight. The chart above simply shows us that outliers exist for all of the major carriers at this airport. This may not seem the case, but some carriers don't have as many flights as others so over the course of the year they will experience more delays in departures.
